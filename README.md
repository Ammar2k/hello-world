# hello-world
making a repository for the first time
learning git for the first time. might end up not being useful but it is an interesting experience nonetheless.
learning R these days, finishing the beginners course and will soon be starting some practical work.
have a project that i should start working on soon, its kind of an internship so it'll be interesting to see how can i transfer my skills to real world analysis without much guidance on each step.
